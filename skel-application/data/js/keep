This folder is for you to serve your own JS files through the Pages' component JS Service.

The URI for this is:


/pages/js/your_app_name:your_js_file.js


given your_js_file.js exists in the current folder.


Remember the code support localization, so given the user has selected the pt_BR locale it will look for:


your_js_file_pt_br.js
your_js_file_pt.js
your_js_file.js


raising exception only if none of those files can be found
