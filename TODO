things that need to be done ASAP:


* template for the setup procedure
	=> try to put the reusable code in a central place
* newcomponent instead of newapp
* update the core application skel to use the dojo 1.7 framework
* figure out a way to manage 3rd parties command line tools and components
	=> kvdriver install component:communities
	=> kvdriver install commandline:useradd
