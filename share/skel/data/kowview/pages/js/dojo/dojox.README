Where did the dojox folder go?


Well, to save up some disk space (and as it's not aways needed) it has been deleted from the kvdriver directory tree.


If you want to, you can download a fresh dojo installment or use a cloud distribution. The one use on this project is dojo-release-1.7.2.tar.gz.


:)


Take care.
