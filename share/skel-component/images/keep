This folder is for you to serve your own image files through the Pages' component Images Service.

The URI for this is:


/pages/images/your_app_name:somefile.png


given somefile.png exists in the current folder.


Remember the code support localization, so given the user has selected the pt_BR locale it will look for:


somefile_pt_br.png
somefile_pt.png
somefile.png


raising exception only if none of those files can be found
